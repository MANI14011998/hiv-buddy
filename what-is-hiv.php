            	<h3 class="header-title">What is HIV</h3>
            	<p>HIV is a virus that gradually attacks the immune system, which is our body’s natural defence against illness. If a person becomes infected with HIV, they will find it harder to fight off infections and diseases. The virus destroys a type of white blood cell called a T-helper cell and makes copies of itself inside them. T-helper cells are also referred to as CD4 cells.1</p>

            	<h3 class="header-title">HIV and Safer Sex</h3>
            	<p>HIV can be transmitted via unprotected sexual intercourse. These methods will help you prevent HIV transmission.</p>
            	<h4 class="secondary-header-title ">Condoms</h4>
                Two types of condom:
                <ul>
                    <li>   Male: fits on a man’s erect penis</li>
                    <li>   Female: fits inside a woman’s vagina</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Do not re-use condoms, or use two at once.</p>
                <p>Use for vaginal, anal and oral sex, and also on sex toys</p>

                <h4 class="secondary-header-title ">Lubricants</h4>
                <p>Lubricant/lube is a liquid that is designed to reduce friction during sex. You can buy bottles of different kinds of lube.

                    Most condoms are coated in lube: this makes penetration easier and prevents condoms breaking or causing tissue damage.

                    Oil-based lube damages latex condoms, so use water-based, or silicone-based lube instead.</p>

                    <h4 class="secondary-header-title ">Dental Damns</h4>
                    <p>Square piece of latex, used as a barrier method like the condom.</p>
                    <ul>
                     <li>Use during oral sex on a woman’s genitals, or on the anus, to prevent oral-vaginal, or oral-anal contact.</li>
                     <li>Use during oral sex on a woman’s genitals, or on the anus, to prevent oral-vaginal, or oral-anal contact.</li>
                     <li>There is a small risk of HIV infection from oral sex on the penis, vagina or anus but only if bleeding sores are present.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h4 class="secondary-header-title ">Sex Toys</h4>
                 <p>There are a wide variety of sex toys available. Share sex toys safely:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Use a condom on a toy.</li>
                    <li>Change the condom when using a toy in different parts of your body (e.g. anus to vagina) and when switching between partners.</li>
                    <li>Wash toys thoroughly (disinfect) when using them in different parts of the body.</li>
                    <li>Wash them thoroughly when switching between partners.</li>
                    <li>Use toys carefully to prevent tearing the vagina/anus or drawing blood</li>
                </ul>





                <h3 class="header-title">Know your rights</h3>

                <p>You have the right to:</p>
