            	<h3 class="header-title">HIV Symptoms and Stages</h3>
            	<p>The symptoms of HIV can differ from person-to-person and some people may not get any symptoms at all. Without treatment, the virus will get worse over time and damage your immune system. We look at the three stages of HIV infection and possible effects.</p>
                <h4 class="secondary-header-title ">Acute primary infection</h4>
                <p>Around one to four weeks after becoming infected with HIV, some people will experience symptoms that can feel a lot like flu. This may not last long (a week or two) and you may only get some of the flu symptoms – or none at all. Experiencing these symptoms alone are not a reliable way of diagnosing HIV.1

                    You should always visit your doctor if you are worried you have been at risk of HIV infection, even if you don’t feel unwell or have any of the following symptoms. They can then arrange for you to have an HIV test.

                    <p class="secondary-header-title">Symptoms can include:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">

                        <li>fever (raised temperature)</li>
                        <li>fever (raised temperature)</li>
                        <li>sore throat</li>
                        <li>swollen glands</li>
                        <li>headache</li>
                        <li>upset stomach</li>
                        <li>body rash</li>
                        <li>joint aches and pains</li>
                        <li>muscle pain.</li></ul>
                        <p>These symptoms can happen because your body is reacting to the HIV virus. Cells that are infected with HIV are circulating throughout your blood system, so your immune system then tries to attack the virus by producing HIV antibodies. This process is called seroconversion, and it usually happens within 45 days of infection and can take up to a few months to complete.</p>

                        <p>It’s important that you always use a condom when having sex, especially if you think you have been exposed to HIV. It may be too early to get an accurate HIV test result at this stage (this can take anything from a few weeks to a few months), but the levels of virus in your blood system are very high at this stage.</p></p>
                        <h4 class="secondary-header-title">The asymptomatic stage</h4>
                        <p>Once the seroconversion stage is over, many people start to feel better. In fact, the HIV virus may not reveal any other symptoms for many years. Health professionals say this could be around 10 years. However, the virus will still be active, infecting new cells and making copies. Over time this will cause a lot of damage to your immune system.</p>
